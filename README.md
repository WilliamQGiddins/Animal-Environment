# Artificial-Animal-Environment
CSC 221 CourseWork
An artificial intelligence environment. There are three types of agents. Carnivore, Herbivore and plant.

Carnivores and herbivores are movable. Carnivores eat herbivores and herbivores eat plants. If a carnivore or herbivore is at a certain range of age and energy then it reproduces. Plants grow on random times on random places. Plants, Carnivores and Herbivores die by aging or being eaten. Herbivores and carnivores can die by loosing energy and not obtaining energy from the environment.

Create the class hierarchy for this simulation and run your simulation for number of iterations. Use character C for Carnivore and H for Herbivore and P for plant and _ for empty place. Create a grid of 30 in 30 and place random Carnnivore and Herbivore and plants over the grid and run the simulation for some iterations (Something like 30 is enough). Movable objects should be able to move to north, south, east or west. Your simulation should be to some degree stable, it means your parameters should be such that the ecosystem is self-sustaining community of organisms living on the grid and not outside the borders.
